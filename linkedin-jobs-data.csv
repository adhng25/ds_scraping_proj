176,,2024-01-25,Tried and True Media,Junior Direct Response Copywriter,"New York, United States","Junior Direct Response Copywriter  Tried and True Media (TNT) is a digital direct response agency in the health/wellness/beauty space who has generated over $1.2B in sales for our clients. We’re hunting the globe for talented direct response copywriters who specialize in high-converting video ad scripts for VSL funnels. You’ll join a kick-ass team of performance managers, media buyers, creative producers and video editors who share a common goal – generate clicks that convert into high ROAS sales that scale client spend. Why join TNT? Because every copywriter knows more reps = more learnings = better results. At TNT, you get a lot of reps writing video scripts end-to-end – positioning, big ideas, hooks, mechanisms, CTAs, etc.     So, if you want to master direct response copywriting/scripting skills, and…  You have a knack for crafting compelling story-driven copy that gets results… You combine logic and emotion to sequence scripts for maximum persuasive impact… You’re extremely analytical and love sifting through data to find the signal in the noise… You thrive in a highly collaborative team environment of other high performers… And you’re extremely organized with tasks and deliver quality copy on time and on spec…  … then please keep reading as you may be the perfect fit.     What are the Key Points?  Core Compensation: $85,000 - $110,000+ (base + company-performance bonus) Control Bonus: Up to $5,000 for EACH winner you write that becomes a control Location: 100% Remote (global team of 60+ with no corporate office) Hours: 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. ET (UTC-5, New York, to standardize our rhythms) Culture: Good Humans Obsessed with Winning for our Clients #1 Objective: Write Breakthrough Video Ad Scripts that Win     Who Will You Report Into?  Hello, my name is Tom Clayson, Creative Performance Director and lead copywriter at TNT, and I need your help. I joined TNT as a junior copywriter back when the team was just me and two other writers and have since worked my way up through the ranks to lead an industry-beating team of writers and video editors. It’s not been an easy journey, but the training and support I received, the easy access to my ads’ performance data, and the hundreds of reps writing video scripts forged me into the writer I am today.     It was one thing to get better by studying the art and science of copywriting when I was just getting started… but nothing collapsed time and progressed my skills to the next level faster than the thrilling, and frequently humbling, experience of testing dozens of my scripts a month in the cold traffic arena where only the fittest survive.     And that’s where you come in. TNT has grown beyond our wildest dreams with over $100M in annual ad spend under management. But we’re only getting started. To sustain that growth, we need a small army of junior direct response copywriters who are eager to learn, can deliver quality under pressure, are driven to win, love being surrounded by creative talent… and who aspire to progress as rapidly as possible in their careers.     What’s the Ideal Candidate’s Background?  The ideal candidate is a native English speaker who has been writing video scripts for VSL funnels for at least 6-12 months for paid social (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, TikTok) or YouTube either for an agency, brand or as a freelancer. Ideally, you also have experience writing for supplements, health and/or beauty. And you’re able to work our standardized hours of 8:30 – 5:30 p.m. ET (UTC-5, New York), regardless of where you live – important so we’re all in the same rhythm and work efficiently.     More importantly… you live and breathe copy, obsessively spending time breaking down winners and losers to gain key insights, truly love the grind of perfecting a piece of copy until it sings… and passionately study the art and science of direct response copy on your own time, because, quite frankly, you simply cannot get enough of this stuff.     You love working in a team environment with other high-caliber creatives. You love to share insights, brainstorm hypotheses, run experiments, collaboratively deconstruct winners and losers and methodically create winner after winner, virtually high-fiving each other along the way.     What’s It Like Working at TNT?  I’ve gone to great lengths to set up a culture that supports rapid learning and success for junior copywriters, as I was once one too. Moreover, we’re extremely heavily focused on collaboration and teamwork to ensure we have proper coverage across all our clients.     For example, we’ve structured our teams into cells, each of which has a portfolio of clients its assigned. Each cell is comprised of a performance manager, media buyer, creative producer, junior and senior copywriters, and video editors. And everyone on the cell marches to the beat of the same drum, focused on the single goal of helping clients hit their spend and ROAS targets.     Regardless of what cell you’re in, everyone benefits from the following:  Access to Data – Access to the same performance data as everyone else so you can instantly see how your creative performs, detect patterns and gain insights Shared Learnings – Participation in our weekly Best Ads call wherein we review the top performers to see what’s working, or not, for everyone else, accelerating your learning Clear Feedback / Mentoring – You’ll be given clear feedback on your scripts and routine mentoring sessions to ensure you continually upskill and develop your craft Subject Variety – You’ll be given a huge variety of subject matter to write about, with a mix of clients who have a mix of offers in your assigned cell, rotating to other cells over time Career Progression – Your success determines how fast you progress to Senior Copywriter… there is no mandated bureaucratic waiting period; only success matters     You’ll be given ideas to flesh out by myself and other senior members of the team. However, a good idea is a good idea, and we always need new ones. So, 20% of the scripts you write will be YOUR ideas that have been greenlit. As you succeed and progress, this % goes even higher.     To me, there’s nothing more satisfying than thinking of an idea, grinding it out into a perfected script, and then having the big “stats” reveal that shows it was a winner… priceless.     What Will You Be Responsible for?  Put simply, it’s writing full video ad scripts for clients’ offers. They could be as short as 30 seconds or as long as 5 minutes. Each script you write will include 5-6 different hooks, all of which will be tested to see what delivers the best ROAS.     As you progress, you’ll be given the opportunity to write leads, closes and other elements for our clients’ VSLs. That brings an entirely new dynamic to your learnings, helps you develop your long-form copy skills and puts you into a position to increase your compensation.     How Will Your Time Be Spent?  While any given week can vary based on client demands, here’s roughly how it shakes out:  35% writing scripts (increasing to 60% in ~3 months) 25% providing feedback to video editors (decreasing to 0% in ~3 months) 20% on calls strategizing, analyzing, brainstorming, getting feedback and being mentored 20% for research and resource gathering to prepare to write     Within 3 months, 60% of your time will be spent doing what you love – writing copy!     How Does Compensation Work?  All copywriters who join TNT go through a maximum 2-month “launchpad” period wherein your skills are developed, and your performance is measured to ensure there is a good fit.     During this launchpad period, compensation is set at a fixed retainer of $6,000 USD per month. Once you graduate from the launchpad, your compensation is upgraded as follows:  $4,000 / month base retainer + $3,000 - $4,000 / month in performance bonuses that are tied to current client ad spend levels However, as we grow ad spend for our clients, so too does your income Copywriters who make it past the launchpad can expect to make $85k - $110k     And here’s where it’s exciting – if your idea and script turns into a control, you get a $5,000 bonus on top of the above base + performance bonuses. So, your earnings are limited only by the number of controls you can write.     Requirements  6-12 Months Video Ad Copywriting Experience – Preferably in the health/wellness/beauty space for VSL funnels with a strong track record of writing winning scripts/controls Native English Speaker – English is your first language and it’s the primary language you speak, write or otherwise communicate in Passionate About Copy – In total awe of and in love with copywriting, appreciating the genius in it, obsessing over every word, phrase, sentence and paragraph Social Media Aware – Actively participate in social media so as to be aware of trending themes, memes, styles, concepts, approaches, etc. Constant Upskilling – Relentlessly works to improve copywriting abilities, studying courses, mentoring with senior writers, deconstructing ads, etc. all to perfect your craft Ownership Mindset – Takes extreme pride in submitting high-quality work that’s on time, on spec, been double checked, meetings all compliance guidelines, etc. Contributes Ideas – Ability to formulate strong ideas and articulate them easily and clearly to others to get feedback and make the ideas even stronger. One last final requirement – If you are interested in the role, please just apply. Don't email or DM me or one of our team members directly.

OSUL faculty apply specialized expertise from library and information science, archival studies, and related fields to ensure that the Oregon State community has rich, organized, affordable, accessible, and inclusive information resources to help the OSU community learn new things, solve difficult problems, investigate important questions, and create knowledge. They also work to create or support the administrative and physical infrastructure that enables delivery of high-quality services. OSUL faculty support the educational mission of the university, both directly and indirectly, by building the dynamic, engaging collections, services, and spaces that foster independent inquiry and learning. They develop and nurture relationships with colleagues, inside the library and out, to support and enrich their work and they participate in the shared governance of OSUL and OSU . They strive to understand the diverse communities they serve, and work to make OSUL an inclusive, just organization.

In order to successfully serve clients across the United States, the Wealthfront team is focused on hiring team members with a diverse range of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.  About Wealthfront  Wealthfront started with the ambition to transform the investment advisory business, with the goal to unlock access to high quality investment advice for millions who were underserved by the traditional institutions. We built the first automated investment product that allows you to invest in a personalized portfolio of thousands of companies in seconds for a remarkably low fee; we then expanded into banking which made it remarkably easy for people to automate their finances end-to-end and eliminated the hassle of money management, all of which resulted in attracting more than $50 billion of our client’s hard earned savings, created the robo-advisor category and transformed the broader industry. And yet, we have a long way to go to achieve our mission to build a financial system that favors people, not institutions.  Wealthfront’s vision is to make it delightfully easy to build long-term wealth on your own terms. This vision is more relevant than ever because millions more people are getting into the market early and investing their hard earned savings in a handful of stocks. While this is a great way to start, it is inconsistent with building long-term wealth. We want to empower young investors to expand their horizon, and easily explore and execute on a wider range of investing strategies, make informed investment decisions that are consistent with their values and beliefs while also making it effortless to grow and compound their savings exponentially, that’s transformational to their lives and their long-term future.

Hello, my name is Tom Clayson, Creative Performance Director and lead copywriter at TNT, and I need your help. I joined TNT as a junior copywriter when the team was just me and two other writers and have since progressed from junior copywriter to performance manager, to senior copywriter, to now leading an industry-beating team of copywriters and video editors. It’s not been an easy journey, but the training and support I received, the easy access to my ads’ performance data, and the hundreds of reps writing video scripts forged me into the writer I am today.     It was one thing to get better by studying the art and science of copywriting when I was just getting started… but nothing collapsed time and progressed my skills to the next level faster than the thrilling, yet humbling, experience of testing dozens of my scripts a month in the cold traffic arena where only the fittest survive.     And that’s where you come in. TNT has grown beyond our wildest dreams with over 9 figures in annual ad spend under management. But we’re only getting started. To sustain that growth, we need a crack team of senior direct response copywriters who can lead their teams into battle and win, deliver quality under pressure, love being surrounded by creative talent… and who aspire to progress as rapidly as possible in their careers.     What’s the Ideal Candidate’s Background?  The ideal candidate is a native English speaker who has been writing video ad scripts for VSL funnels for at least a year for paid social (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, TikTok) or YouTube either for an agency, brand or as a freelancer. You’ve also had significant experience writing/testing various VSL components - particularly leads and closes. Ideally, you also have experience writing for supplements, health and/or beauty products. And you’re able to work our standardized hours of 8:30 – 5:30 p.m. ET (UTC-5, New York), regardless of where you live – important so we’re all in the same rhythm and work efficiently.     More importantly… you live and breathe copy, obsessively spending time breaking down winners and losers to gain key insights, truly love the grind of perfecting a piece of copy until it sings… and passionately study the art and science of direct response copy on your own time, because, quite frankly, you simply cannot get enough of this stuff.     What’s It Like Working at TNT?  I’ve gone to great lengths to set up a culture that supports the creative freedom, skill progression and handsome compensation that senior copywriters deserve. Moreover, we’re extremely heavily focused on collaboration and teamwork to ensure we have proper coverage across all our clients.     For example, we’ve structured our teams into cells, each of which has a portfolio of clients its assigned. Each cell is comprised of a performance manager, media buyer, creative producer, junior and senior copywriters, and video editors. Every is focused on the single goal of helping clients hit their spend and ROAS targets. Senior writers have a primary cell they work in but will be called in to write new ads for offers outside their cell as well.     Regardless of what cell you’re in, everyone benefits from the following:     Access to Data – Access to the same performance data as everyone else so you can instantly see how your creative performs, detect patterns and gain insights.     Shared Learnings – Participation in our weekly Best Ads call wherein we review the top performers to see what’s working, or not, for everyone else, accelerating your learning.     Clear Feedback / Mentoring – You’ll be given clear feedback on your scripts and routine mentoring sessions to ensure you continually upskill and develop your craft.     Subject Variety – You’ll be given a huge variety of subject matter to write about, with a mix of clients who have a mix of offers in your assigned cell, rotating to other cells over time.     Career Progression – Your success determines how fast your income progresses… there is no mandated bureaucratic waiting period; only success matters. Prove yourself and your skills and, as the need arises as the agency grows, you could be joining me as Copy-Chief.     You’ll often be given ideas to flesh out by myself or the performance manager in your cell. However, the most important part of your role will be to come up with new ideas and angles. From there it’s your choice whether to grind them out into a perfected script yourself or assign them to one of your junior writers and approve the final script. Either way, the goal is always to savor the moment when the stats are revealed showing your handywork was a winner…priceless.     What Will You Be Responsible for?  There are two major types of writing you’ll be asked to do:     First is writing full video ad scripts for clients’ offers. This will be 90% of the writing you do in an average week. The scripts could be as short as 30 seconds or as long as 5 minutes. Each script will include at least 5-6 different hooks, which will be tested to see what delivers the best ROAS.     Second, is writing or rewriting leads, closes and other key elements for our clients’ VSLs. This responsibility helps you develop your long form copy skills and puts you into a position to increase your compensation even further.     How Will Your Time Be Spent?  While any given week can vary based on client demands, here’s roughly how it shakes out:     40% writing scripts (increasing to 60% in ~3 months) 20% providing feedback to video editors (decreasing to 0% in ~3 months) 20% on calls or in Slack strategizing, analyzing, brainstorming, getting feedback, mentoring or being mentored 20% for research and resource gathering to prepare to write     Within 3 months, 60% of your time will be spent doing what you love – writing copy!     How Does Compensation Work?  All copywriters who join TNT go through a maximum 2-month “launchpad” period wherein your skills are developed, and your performance is measured to ensure there is a good fit.     During this launchpad period, compensation is set at a fixed retainer of $8,000 USD per month. Once you graduate from the launchpad, your compensation is upgraded as follows:     $6,000 / month base retainer + $5,500 - $7,500 / month (at current typical client ad spend levels) in agency performance bonuses So, as we grow ad spend for our clients, your income grows too Copywriters who make it past the launchpad can expect to make $138,000 - $162,000     And here’s where it’s exciting – if your idea and script turns into a control, you get a $5,000 bonus on top of the above base + performance bonuses. So, your earnings are limited only by the number of controls you can write.     Requirements  Minimum 1-year Video Ad Copywriting Experience – Preferably in the health/wellness/beauty space for VSL funnels with a strong track record of winners     VSL Writing Experience – Exposure writing leads, CTAs, closes and other high-leverage VSL elements that move the needle on conversion rate and AOV     Fluent English Speaker – Proficient at a native level and it’s the primary language you speak, write, or otherwise communicate in     Passionate About Copy – In total awe of and in love with copywriting, appreciating the genius in it, obsessing over every word, phrase, sentence and paragraph     Constant Upskilling – Relentlessly works to improve copywriting abilities, studying courses, mentoring with senior writers, deconstructing ads, etc. all to perfect your craft     Ownership Mindset – Takes extreme pride in submitting high-quality work that’s on time, on spec, been double checked, meetings all compliance guidelines, etc.     Contributes Ideas – Ability to formulate strong ideas and articulate them easily and clearly to others to get feedback and make the ideas even stronger     IMPORTANT: If you are interested in the role, please apply.

Project Outline  Many drugs bind to receptors expressed on multiple cell types and in different tissues, which may be different from the drug’s target tissue. Consequently, a drug may bind to the correct receptor but in the wrong tissue, leading to toxicity. Additionally, numerous drugs exhibit avidity effects, where the binding between the target and drug deviates from the typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics due to factors not solely captured by the binding constant, such as self-interactions between drug molecules or the drug binding to multiple receptors on a cell surface. These avidity effects may lead to drugs with a low therapeutic index in vivo, which is not predicted by in vitro binding data.  System models are commonly employed to separately model efficacy or safety, but there are few instances in the literature where both aspects were considered to estimate the therapeutic index. However, drug-receptor binding kinetics are typically well understood and characterized, therefore mechanistic systems biology modeling is well-suited for generating a more accurate estimate of the therapeutic index for drugs exhibiting avidity. This project aims to explore the relationship between the therapeutic index and key drug parameters by explicitly modeling both on- and off-tissue drug-target binding, including avidity effects, through the use of quantitative systems modeling.  This project will consist of two case studies to explore avidity effects on therapeutic index. The first is related to Takeda transferrin receptor agonist programs where toxicity was observed in rodents that was not predicted by another program with a similar molecular format. One hypothesis for this toxicity is that multiple drug molecules are aggregating and binding to transferrin receptors on off-tissue cells, resulting blocking of the transferrin receptors and toxicity due to this avidity effect. The team is attempting to optimize future drug candidates by altering the binding affinities or considering monovalent instead of bivalent drugs. This case study will investigate the optimal parameter relationships such as the drug self-interaction/aggregation strength, the drug half-life, and the binding constant between the drug and the target receptors, as a function of receptor expression level on both on- and off-tissue cells, which will aid the team in future drug discovery and development.  The second case study is an investigation of a common binding pattern in oncology drugs where a bispecific drug binds to two receptors on the same cell surface, resulting in avidity effects due to a difference between 3-dimensional and 2-dimensional receptor binding. Along these lines, this case study aims to investigate the optimal binding strengths for each drug-receptor binding interaction to maximize the therapeutic index of a drug with this mechanism of action.  The intern’s responsibilities will include coding model using MATLAB, R, Python, or Julia to investigate the question of maximizing therapeutic index for various model structures based on the relevant biology in each case study, mining literature for biologically relevant parameters ranges, using sensitivity analysis to find most influential parameters on therapeutic index, and simulating the model to explore results. Time permitting, the intern may also implement nonlinear mixed effects models to explore the effects of inter-individual variability. This project includes a possible opportunity for publication of the results. This project will be hybrid.  How you will contribute   Exceptional interpersonal, verbal communication and writing skills. Deadline-driven with an elevated level of organizational and planning skills.
